4ayyaa,post,My friend told me it's not safe for me to run early morning at Bedok Reservoir Park by myself?,"I've just moved near Bedok Reservoir Park. Picked this area because I was planning to run a few times a week.

Went for a morning run at around 6am the other day..   
When my friend heard about it, he told me it's not safe for a girl to run alone when it's still dark outside.. apparently there have been some incidents in the past. Is it true?

I mean, there were quite a lot of people around the ""main"" areas, but for most of the run, I met maybe 6~7 other runners.

If it's really not safe, are there any alternative running place nearby? Or any running group I can join?

The inner gravel path and asphalt track leading to the hill is well lit. But perhaps you would like to avoid the path that follows after the asphalt track leading up to the hill (and the loop around the back of the hill) which may be a little darker and secluded.",2016-03-19 00:31:25,4,,ZanDisk,0,4ayyaa,t3_4ayyaa

I've never heard of it as being a dangerous place. Did your friend mention details of the cases? There have been suicide cases at the reservoir - so, it's rumoured to be haunted - but to my knowledge, there are no murder or rape cases there.

It's a safe place to run at night, but I'm not sure about mornings. At night, especially on weekends, you can see a handful of foreign workers (PRCs and Indians) drinking and laughing with their friends, but they do not pose a danger to anyone.

If you're afraid, I suggest running at the track closest to the waters where it is lighted. Don't venture to the unlighted outer tracks where the trees are. ",2016-03-19 00:44:32,25,,hannorx,0,4ayyaa,t3_4ayyaa

The friend alr qualified his statement with not safe for a girl to run alone la. I agree with him. There have been incidents of assaults on lone female joggers in sg, but off the top of my head i can only rem the clementi woods one though.

Bedok reservoir more famous for the number of suicides. There was a rape but it was a father-daughter one i think.

Statistically the odds are very low, but low probability/ high severity still not worth it. Avoid routes with long stretches that are dark and secluded, or run with someone.",2016-03-19 02:01:56,15,,WoodenSwordsman,0,4ayyaa,t3_4ayyaa

Reported rape cases here are usually between 100 - 200 annually, not withstanding the fact that rape is an under reported crime. Most sexual assault cases don't get news coverage, for obvious reasons. 

But to be fair only about 10-20% of those are stranger rape cases, so for this jogging context it's actually between 10 to 40 each year.",2016-03-20 02:03:52,2,,WoodenSwordsman,0,4ayyaa,t1_d15e6gf

Unfortunately, they’re everywhere now, in newborns, at the Everest peak, at the base of Mariana Trench. I wouldn’t say that seafood is a predominant source. In fact, the majority of microplastics originate from synthetic fibres used in clothing and other everyday products. 

The health effects of microplastics are still gradually being uncovered. As of now, to my knowledge, nothing substantially concrete about its harm to human health has been established. That being said my money is that it has negative effects that will take time to be recognised.

Regarding the eating of invasives, 90-95% of all species in the reservoirs are invasives my dude. Wild Singapore does not have large, relatively stagnant natural catchment areas. Therefore our native species are not found in reservoirs which are exactly this.

please check up on those that you care deeply about - regardless of circumstances. it doesn't matter if you havent spoke in a while, have past tensions, or you are afraid of crossing boundaries. if you feel the want to reach out and ask - ask. let them know they are on your mind. sometimes the smallest moments like these - truly impact the outcomes drastically.

your mental health matters. you matter. its okay to reach out, be it if you need the help, or you are extending your help to someone.

she will be missed dearly by everyone who knew her.

sometimes it seems like it will be easier to leave it all behind but i promise you - it will get better. with time, support and love. pain is temporary. please remember to take care of yourself. 

rest in peace young one, i hope your pain has stopped and you are at peace now. your memory and legacy will continue, and you will not be forgotten, nor remembered for your final moments, but for the good you brang. a reminder to express our love for those we hold close to our hearts.",2024-07-26 01:36:59,6,,Sad_Position_553,0,1ea7o0j,t3_1ea7o0j
